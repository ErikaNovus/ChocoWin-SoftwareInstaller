**Basic batch file for installing software on a new windows machine. Created to manage any new Windows installations that I complete in future as it makes my life easier.**
**When running the batch file the user is given a list of instructions to follow to install any of the programs i've built in using the chocolatey package installer.**

*NOTE: Chocolatey Package Installer is installed by default when the script is run and "install" is chosen when prompted. The code has been written to download CPI even behind a proxy in case an installation is needed at a workplace.*
